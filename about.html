      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Welcome to Melrose High School's Student Tech Leaders program!

Student Tech is an exciting program that allows technology-minded students in grades 10, 11, and 12 to pursue a unique learning opportunity individually tailored to interests in the fields of technology and education. The course focuses on three main principles:</p>

<p>Student - each student is expected to design an original self-directed project that involves a technology-centered 
  learning opportunity. Each student, working individually or in a group, is responsible for planning a final product 
  and building the skills and knowledge required to achieve their goal. Through careful planning, checkpoints, and 
  reflective blog posts, Student Tech Leaders are encouraged to pursue their own technological interests within a framework of inquiry and creativity.</p>

<p>Tech - It should go without saying that technology is at the heart of the program. Whether students are working with the new Learning Commons' 
  3D printer, the makerspace, or developing their own website, all units and projects will enable the hands-on development of skills related to creative 
  tech problem solving.</p>
<p>Leaders - The foundation of Student Tech is leadership. Each student will be expected to act as the technology leaders for the high school through 
  modeling behavior expected of all Melrose High School students.</p>
